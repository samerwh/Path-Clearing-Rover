# Path Clearing Rover

This repository contains the code for my Mechatronics System Design course project. 
The project is a line-following rover that can avoid or push an object located on its path. 

The python scripts were run on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+. Two infrared sensors are used to detect the line. 
The rover is equipped with a camera that detects text on the object to decide what action it should take.
