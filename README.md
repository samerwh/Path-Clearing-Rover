# Path Clearing Rover

This repository contains the code for my Mechatronics System Design course project. 
The project is a line-following rover that can avoid or push an object located on its path. 

The python scripts were run on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+. Two infrared sensors are used to detect the line and an ultransonic distance sensor detects obstructing objects.
The rover is also equipped with a camera to detect text and decide whether to avoid *right*, avoid *left*, or *push* the object.
